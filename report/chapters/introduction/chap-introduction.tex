    Pokemon is an old game that has continued to be relevant for nearly 30 years \cite{Pokemon}. 
During its lifespan there have been many different ways to enjoy the games, ranging from casually playing through them 
to competitive battles in international tournaments \cite{WaysToPlayPokemon}. Pokemon games have always had a lot of 
nuances in their gameplay, most notably battling. A Pokemon battle can have multiple formats, single, double or sometimes 
even triple battles. Different moves can have a chance of causing secondary effects. Attacks have a chance to critically 
strike the opponent causing significantly more damage than normal. These factors among others make Pokemon battles an 
interesting subject for analysis through AI agents \cite{PokeEnv}, as these effects can radically change the outcome 
of a battle. 

Training an agent to do well in a high variance environment like that can improve our general understanding 
of how to perform better in Pokemon battles.
