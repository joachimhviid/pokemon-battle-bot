\section{Problem}
\label{sec:problem-description}

Pokemon battles are high in variance and certain random effects can change 
the course of a battle or change how the player needs to act in order to 
come out on top. Using AI agents and machine learning, we want to find out 
if it's possible to improve as a human player by analysing how a trained 
agent plays. We want to find out if it is possible to calculate the odds 
of winning a battle ahead of time given a predefined set of Pokemon.
