This report has described the process of creating a Pokemon battle simulator and teaching AI agents how to play Pokemon.
The project set out figure out if humans could improve their play by analyzing the strategies that the AI agents come up
with. Through multiple training sessions, the agents have learned a lot, however more training is required in order to 
make a formal conclusion about whether it will surpass a human player. The results show steady improvements over time, but
there is a long way to go before the agent will win any tournaments.

The project wanted to provide a quick way to calculate the odds of a player winning given two sets of Pokemon. This has
partially been solved, but a clear interface is missing in order to ship it as a final product.
