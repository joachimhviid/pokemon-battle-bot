\section{Discussion}
\label{sec:discussion}

To round out this chapter, we will discuss the outcomes of this project. We will look back at what has been done
and reflect on how it compares with the initial problem statement. Then we will reflect on what we would do if we had more time.

\subsection{Did we solve the initial problem?}
Looking back to the problem described in section \ref{sec:problem-description}, it is stated that: 
\begin{quote}
  \itshape{We want to find out if it's possible to improve as a human player by analysing how a trained agent plays.}
\end{quote}
We created a custom environment and agent that was succesfully trained across thousands of episodes. After each training 
loop the agent became better and better. At the agents current level, it is unlikely to consistently beat a human opponent,
but given enough time and training, this agent will eventually become a stronger player, that we as humans can learn from.
Therefore, that part of the problem is considered solved.

An additional problem was described as:
\begin{quote}
  \itshape{We want to find out if it is possible to calculate the odds of winning a battle ahead of time given a predefined set of Pokemon.}
\end{quote}
This part was not fully implemented, but all of the necessary groundwork was created. The remaining work involved in solving
this part of the problem would be creating a command line interface where two files with team data could be specified. 
Then, the pretrained AI model would be used to run 1.000-10.000 episodes depending on the desired accuracy. The amount of wins
and losses experienced during the episodes would then be returned to the user, that can then use this info to determine 
the odds of winning a given matchup. Additionally, a sample log could then be used to recreate the winning episodes.

\subsection{What would we do in the future?}
