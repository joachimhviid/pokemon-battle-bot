\section{The good and the bad parts}
\label{sec:good-bad-parts}

\subsection{Good parts}
The simulator works both with custom and external environments, providing great flexibility depending
on what kind of training is desired. The custom environment, while not fully feature complete, is open to extension and
can support multiple game environments, such as different generations of game rules. The external environment, Poke-env, 
supports most features found in the Pokemon games and comes with a visual replay option for presenting discovered strategies.

\subsection{Bad parts}
The custom environment is not feature complete. The simulator will only provide good results if its environment reflects
reality. While the missing features were declared in the initial requirements as optional for the purposes finishing the
project within the allotted time, they are crucial to provide accurate results to be used in a real product.

The training process is slower than anticipated. During training, we measured an average of 20 episodes per second. This 
is due to both environments being heavily CPU bound with limited processing able to be sent to the GPU. The training time
can most likely be improved in the custom environment by vectorizing the observations provided and by implementing 
multi-threading to divy up the work performed by the CPU to multiple threads.
