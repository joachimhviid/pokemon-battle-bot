\section{Performance evaluation}
\label{sec:performance-evaluation}

% TODO

\begin{itemize}
    \item Profiling results (e.g., from cProfile)
    \item Identified bottlenecks (e.g., torch.to() overhead, environment logic)
    \item Actions taken or possible (e.g., vectorization, caching, batch encoding)
    \item How these affected GPU utilization and training speed
\end{itemize}

Custom environment 20 iterations pr second
Poor GPU utilization (around 40 percent)

Poke-env 10 iterations pr second with fluctuations going as low as 5 iterations pr second
Better GPU utilization (around 90-95 percent)
