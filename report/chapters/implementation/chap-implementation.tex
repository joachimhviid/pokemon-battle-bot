\chapter{Implementation}
\label{chap:implementation}

The development of the project was carried out in several iterations, while each 
improving upon the last in terms of functionality and modularity.
The first two iterations were carried out using the Poke-env library, and a 
custom agent. The last iteration focused on the implementation of a custom 
environment and changeing the agent to use the custom environment.


We can refer to Chapter~\ref{chap:analysis-and-design} for something.

% We refer to Listing~\ref{lst:sum} for the Java implementation.\\ % force new line
% Code snippets like \lstinline{System.out.println} can also be given inside a sentence.

% \begin{lstlisting}[language=java,caption={Our sum implementation},float=tb,label=lst:sum]
%   class Sum {
%     public static void main(String[] args) {
%       int n = 5;   // the input
%       int sum = n * (n+1);
%       System.out.println("The sum is: " + sum);
%     }
%   }
% \end{lstlisting}

% Finally we can refer to some material in Appendix~\ref{appendix:api-doc}.
