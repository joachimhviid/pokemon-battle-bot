\section{Frameworks}
\label{sec:Frameworks}

Frameworks is an important part of any software development project.
They provide a foundation for the project and can help speed up processes
during devleopment. This section goes in depth on what the different frameworks
are and can provide to this project.

\subsection{Machine Learning frameworks}

Machine learning frameworks is a crucial choice to make when considering development,
training and deployment of an Artificial Intelligence (AI) model.
There are many frameworks available, but among the most widely used are TensorFlow
and PyTorch. They have both appeared dominant in their repective fields and are used
by some of the biggest tech companies in the world, like Google, Microsoft and Meta.\cite{PyTorchVsTensorFlow}

\subsubsection{TensorFlow}
TensorFlow was the first of the of the 2 frameworks to be released,
and was developed by Google. \cite{TensorFlow} It is widely adopted for
larger-scale machine learning applications and for production grade AI systems,
because of its scalability and robustness. \cite{simplilearn}
Because of all these features TensorFlow has become a very versatile framework,
but has created a higher learning curve and its static computation graphs can hinder our development.

\subsubsection{PyTorch}
PyThorch was developed by Meta and after its release it quickly gained popularity due to its dynamic
computation graphs, better debugging capabilites and pythonic approach. \cite{PyTorch}

PyTorch might be limited in production readiness and have inferior performance compared to
TensorFlow when working on larger scale projects, but because of its strenghts and being faster
than TensorFlow on smaller-scale models it has made a huge leap in favorability in
scientific-research and smaller scale projects. \cite{simplilearn}

\subsection{Design decision: ML Frameworks}
The selection of a machine learning framework is a key architectual decision, that
will have a significant impact on the models development, debugging, training efficiency,
and integration with other components. The two leading frameworks that were considered were
TensorFlow and PyTorch. 

\textbf{TensorFlow}, developed by Google, is widely adopted in industry for building 
and deploying large-scale machine learning systems. It offers robust tools along with
a versatile framework that supports production-grade AI applications. Its sttic computation
graphs can improve performance in production scnearios and is generally favoured for 
large-scale applications. However, TensorFlow comes with a muc hsteeper learning curve,
especially for beginners. Its static graph model can complicate debugging and 
limit flexibility during development often requiring additional abstraction layers.

On the other hand, \textbf{PyTorch}, developed by Meta/Facebook, is known for its dynamic
computation grpahs, which allows for greater flexibility and ease of use. It adopts a
more pythonic coding style, making it more intuitive to devlopers already familiar with
Python. PyTorch also integrates well with tools such as jupyter notebooks and Gymnasium,
which are usefull for reinforcement learning tasks and interactive development. Additionally,
PyTorch has shown faster training times for smaller-scale models, which aligns well with
the scope and scale of this project.

Despite the limitations in production-readiness and scalability and the fact that the
Poke-env environment that we are using is made using TensorFlow, the decision was made
to use Pytorch for this project. The reasons for this was due to its flexibility, better
debugging support and smoother development experience and learning curve. The advantages
were particularly important given the iterative nature of designing and tuning of reinforcement
agent, where frequent model adjustments and state inspections are necessary. 

In conclusion, Pytorch provided a more accessible and developer-friendly framework for
implementing and experimenting with Deep Q-Networks, making it a suitable choice for this
bachelor-level project.
