In order to simulate a Pokemon battle, it is necessary to have the data needed for a Pokemon battle to take place.
The simulator needs data on Pokemon species and their stats and moves, as well as data on what the individual moves do.
It needs to know about Pokemon abilities and held items, and how they interact with eachother.

for this purpose.

\subsection{Kaggle}
\subsection{PokeAPI}
\subsection{Data mining}
% .pbs dumping from game files?
