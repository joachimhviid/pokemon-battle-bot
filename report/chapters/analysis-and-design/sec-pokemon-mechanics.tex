\section{Pokemon mechanics}
\label{sec:pokemon-mechanics}

The Pokemon games are home to a vast amount of mechanics. In order to fully understand
this project, it is important to have a basic understanding of the mechanics present in a Pokemon battle.

The following section aims to briefly explain these mechanics.

\subsection{Type chart}
A Pokemon will under normal circumstances have 1 or 2 types that represents its elemental alignment and similarly a Pokemon move will have 1 type.
Each type determines its effectiveness against other types. The effectivenesses are categorized as follows:
\begin{itemize}
  \item No effect (0x multiplier)
  \item Not very effective (0.5x multiplier)
  \item Effective (1x multiplier)
  \item Super effective (2x multiplier)
\end{itemize}
These multipliers are stacking, so if a Pokemon has 2 types that resists an incoming attack, the multiplier becomes $ 0.5*0.5=0.25 $.
\notebox{Example: A fire type Pokemon, Charmander, is in a battle with the water type Pokemon, Squirtle.
  The Squirtle uses the water type move Water Gun against the Charmander. As water is super effective against fire, the move
  Water Gun receives a 2x multiplier to its damage.}

For the full list of type advantages and disadvantages, see appendix \ref{appendix:type-chart}.

\subsection{Stats}
A Pokemons power is determined by its stats. Since generation 2 a Pokemon has been described by the following stats:
\begin{itemize}
  \item HP: Determines the amount of hit points a Pokemon has. The more hit points a Pokemon has, the more durable it is.
  \item Attack: Determines the power of physical attacking moves.
  \item Defense: Determines a Pokemons resistance to physical attacking moves.
  \item Special Attack: Determines the power of special attacking moves.
  \item Special Defense: Determines a Pokemons resistance to special attacking moves.
  \item Speed: Determines a Pokemons speed, which is used to determine who goes first in a round of battle.
\end{itemize}
A Pokemons stats are influenced by a few factors: its base stats, level, nature, individual values and effort values.
Together they compose the Pokemons actual stats.

\subsubsection{IVs and EVs}
Individual values \cite{IndividualValues} and effort values \cite{EffortValues} (referred to as IVs and EVs) are hidden values attributed to a Pokemon to create variety in each Pokemons power levels within its species.
When a Pokemon is encountered it will be generated with IVs ranging from 0-31 for each of its stats. A higher IV will result in a higher total stat.

EVs are values gained through battles. A Pokemon can have a total number of 510 EVs with a limit of 255 points per stat.

\subsubsection{Natures}
A Pokemons nature \cite{Natures} is determined when it is generated. A nature gives a Pokemon a Â±10\% modifier to select stats.
If a nature both raises and lowers a stat it is called a "Neutral nature" and no changes will occur to the final stat.
Please refer to table \ref{tab:nature-table} for the full list of natures and their effects.

\subsubsection{Stat boosts}
Stat boosts are temporary modifiers applied to a Pokemons stat in combat. A stat is raised and lowered in stages ranging from -6 to +6 \cite{StatBoosts}.
Certain moves or abilites can raise or lower a Pokemons stat in stages. By default all stats begin at stage 0, meaning no change.

  }

\subsubsection{Formula}
With the above sections in mind, the final stat value of a Pokemon can be calculated using the following formulas \cite{PokemonStats}.
Please note that the HP stat has a different formula compared to the other stats.

\begin{figure}
  $$
    HP = \left\lfloor \frac{(2 * Base + IV + \left\lfloor \frac{EV}{4} \right\rfloor) * Level}{100} \right\rfloor + Level + 10
  $$
  
  $$
    OtherStat = \left\lfloor \left( \left\lfloor \frac{(2 * Base + IV + \left\lfloor \frac{EV}{4} \right\rfloor) * Level}{100} \right\rfloor + 5 \right) * NatureMod \right\rfloor
  $$

\subsection{Status conditions}
In pokemon there exists a variety of status conditions that fall into either of two categories: Volatile and Non-volatile. Non-volatile status conditions
lasts until a pokemon is healed, and volatile conditions only lasts for the duration of a battle. \cite{StatusCondition}
\begin{itemize}
  \item Poison (PSN): Is a condition non-volatile that deals 1/8 of the pokemon's health at the end of each turn and can only be avoided by a few abilities,
  moves or items.
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Badly Poisoned: Is another type of the non-volatile poison status condition that starts to deal 1/16 at the start of a turn, 
      but increases the damage taken by 1/16 every turn, so after 3 turns it deals 3/16 of a pokemons health. 
      This condition can be avoided by the same abilities, moves or items as the normal poison condition.
  \end{itemize}
  \item Burn (BRN): Is another non-volatile status condition that deals 1/16 from generation 1 and 7 onwards while also cutting the pokemons attack stat
    in half until the pokemon is heald. There are one ability and move that negates the attack drop from burn and turns it into an attack boost instead.
  \item Sleep (SLP): This condition causes a pokemon unable to use moves, except snore and sleep talk and 
    randomly lasts 1 to 3 turns in generation 5 and onwards. The first turn of sleep is always skipped.
  \item Paralysis (PAR): Is a non-volatile status condition that has a 25\% chance of preventing the pokemon from moving each turn and reducedes a pokemons
    speed 50\% from generation 7 onwards.
  \item Freeze (FRZ): This is a non-volatile condition that renders the pokemon unable to move unless, it thawes out by a 20\% chance or 
    by using a move to thaw it out.
  \item Confusion: Is a type of volatile status condition that has a 33\% chance of causing a pokemon to hurt itself in its confusion instead of executing
    a selected move.
  \item Flinch: The flinch status is volatile and prevents an oppossing pokemon from moving for the turn it was flinched. This can be done by moves like 
    fake out that has Priority +3, and rock slide that has a 30\% chance of flinching if you move before the oppossing pokemon.
  \item Others: There are a lot of other volatile status conditions that are not as common as the ones mentioned above.
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Grounded: Pokemon that are grounded looses their imunity to ground type moves.
    \item Nightmare: Only affects sleeping pokemon and deal 1/4 of their hp each turn they stay asleep.
    \item Curse: Deals 1/4 of the users hp each turn if used by a ghost type. If not lowers the users speed by 1 stage and increases 
      the users attack and defense by 1 stage.
