  Pokemon battles are complex environments with high variance. There are many factors that affect the outcome of a battle.
  Did a Pokemon land a critical hit? Did a move miss its target at a crucial moment? This project aims to learn how to
  optimize battle strategies and calculate how well a team of Pokemon match up against another team of Pokemon. 
  The project explores the use of reinforcement learning implemented using Gymnasium with Pytorch in order 
  to achieve these goals. The project uses Deep Q-Networks to train its AI agents used for the strategy optimizations.
  The project describes the implementation of both pre-built environments and custom environments used by the agents.
  Finally, the project reflects on the findings gathered during the training of the agents.
